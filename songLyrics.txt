Cut the music up
A lil' louder
Yeah
You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had love
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love
Oh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, oh
See, I just want you to know
That you deserve the best, you're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeah
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
Far from the usual
You see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
Yeah, see, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
One, two, three, four
Hey, hey (forever)
Hey, hey (forever)
It's you and me
Moving at the speed of light into eternity, yeah
Tonight is the night
To join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music
Around you, around you
I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there
So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby
We can go anywhere, go anywhere
But first, it's your chance, take my hand, come with me
It's like I waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me, you, and the dance floor
'Cause we only got one night
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance forever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, ever
Forever (forever)
Ever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, ever (hey)
Forever on the dance floor
Feels like we're on another level, yeah
Feels like our love's intertwined
We can be two rebels breaking the rules
Me and you, you and I
All you gotta do is watch me (watch me)
Look what I can do with my feet (my feet)
Baby, feel the beat inside
I'm driving, you can take the front seat (front seat)
Just need you to trust me (trust me)

Forever on the dance floor
It's a long way down, we so high off the ground
Sendin' for an angel to bring me your heart
Girl, where did you come from? Got me so undone
Gaze in your eyes got me sayin'
"What a beautiful lady", no ifs, ands, or maybes
I'm releasin' my heart, and it's feelin' amazing
There's no one else that matters, you love me
And I won't let you fall, girl (fall, girl), let you fall, girl, oh
Oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, I won't let you fall, let you fall
Let you fall, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
It's like, it's like I waited my whole life (whole life)
For this one night (one night)
It's gon' be me, you, and the dance floor (me, you, and the dance floor)
'Cause we only got one night
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance forever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, ever
Forever (forever)

Forever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, ever
Forever on the dance floor
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, yeah
Forever, ever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, oh
